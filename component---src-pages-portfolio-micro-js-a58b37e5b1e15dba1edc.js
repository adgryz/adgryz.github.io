People who work remotely and owners of apartments for rent. Based on the screener we built, we gathered the right number of people to conduct the study. They were gathered using the snowball method. The group of respondents consisted of 15 people (10 working and 5 owners) from cities with population over 100 000 citizens. On the basis of the created research scenario we conducted in-depth interviews in a remote form with the help of Google Meet.",images:[{original:r},{original:s},{original:c},{original:d}]},{title:"Strategy",description:"Once the interviews were completed, we created 5 personas based on the notes and information collected (which were narrowed down over time to 1 Guest persona and 1 Host persona. ) Through the user research, we drew many conclusions that largely confirmed our hypotheses. \nPeople who work remotely cannot find themselves in the new reality, they suffer from lack of social contacts, they do not have enough space in their apartments, their work-life balance is disturbed. \nPeople who, before the pandemic, were involved in short-term apartment rentals have lost a steady source - of income. On the other hand, people who have never rented their apartment are apprehensive about potential tenants and are not convinced about long-term renting - they prefer to focus on short-term renting. \n\nTools such as Value Proposition and Customer Jurney Map helped us to go through the thinking process of potential users and define their fears and concerns so we could develop the best solutions for them. \nTaking into account the fact that people more willingly and often use mobile applications, we decided to create a solution for mobile devices with the Android operating system. We were inspired by generally known products existing on the market, taking into account such aspects as: friendly interface, social elements, search, exchange, sale of products or services.\n",images:[{original:p},{original:l},{original:f},{original:h},{original:g},{original:u},{original:b},{original:m}]},{title:"Modeling",description:"In the next step, we created user scenarios that helped visualize the path users would go through when using our application.
