People who, before the pandemic, were involved in short-term apartment rentals have lost a steady source - of income. On the other hand, people who have never rented their apartment are apprehensive about potential tenants and are not convinced about long-term renting - they prefer to focus on short-term renting.\\n\\nTools such as Value Proposition and Customer Jurney Map helped us to go through the thinking process of potential users and define their fears and concerns so we could develop the best solutions for them. Taking into account the fact that people more willingly and often use mobile applications, we decided to create a solution for mobile devices with the Android operating system.
